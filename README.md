# gui-rainmeters 🌧️📐
My personal rainmeter workspace.

# Summary (or motivation)
[Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) is a widget system for Windows. 
I love custom desktops. 
This repository is a collection of my Rainmeter skins and layouts, saved for posterity, in case I need a clean start for a new system, stuff like that. This readme file is also for future-me so I know how to configure everything.

# Skins
The skins folder contains various rainmeter skins that I've customized to fit my layouts. All credits goes to the skin creators. To use the skins in this repo, just point your `SkinPath` to this repo's folder on the `Rainmeter.ini` file.

Now, Rainmeter will load the skins from this repo and I can easily add or edit the skins and commit them to the repo.

# Layouts
The Layouts folder contains my saved Rainmeter layouts. You should be able to download the package file and import them into your system, provided you have also downloaded the skins and put them in the Rainmeter's Skins directory.

## Outrun 1.0.0 (1920x1080)

Inspired by the classic Outrun synthwave scenes, this the layout I'm using on my main gig. This skin is not for the faint-hearted or the _minimalist_ crowd. This is Cyberpunk-inspired **INFORMATION OVERLOAD [📟📱📡📉📈📊🗺️🪐]** for the multi taskers out there.

It centers around the TouchTerminal's skins, featuring a very cool system monitor by X2ui. Since I'm a space nerd, I'm also using AstroWeather to fetch the planet's positions relative to me, weather forecast. I'm also using ISS skin to see the next time the space station passes by my coords. I also hooked up a Covid Stats tracker for Brazil and a Google News feed from Enigma. The note taking app and calendar widgets from Zephyr bring a nice color contrast.
